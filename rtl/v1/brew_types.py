# Exception types:
'''
The following exceptions are supported:

- MIP: MMU Exception on the instruction port (details are in EX_ADDR_I/EX_OP_I)
- MDP: MMU Exception on the data port (details are in EX_ADDR_D/EX_OP_D)
- SWI: SWI instruction (details are in the ECAUSE/RCAUSE registers)
- CUA: unaligned access

Since we do posted writes (or at least should supported it), we can't really do precise bus error exceptions. So, those are not precise:

- IAV: interconnect access violation
- IIA: interconnect invalid address (address decode failure)
- ITF: interconnect target fault (target signaled failure)

These - being imprecise - can't be retried, so if they occur in TASK mode, the only recourse is to terminate the app, and if they happen in SCHEDULER mode, they will reboot, after setting RCAUSE and, if possible, RADDR.

All these sources are mapped into the ECAUSE and RCAUSE registers:
