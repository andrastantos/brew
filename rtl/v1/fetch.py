"""
In V1, fetch works from a 16-bit read port: it gets (up to) 16-bits of data at a time.

It constructs full instructions and supplies them to decode.

We don't do any branch-prediction, or to be more precise, we're following
straight-line execution, until told otherwise.

We don't support any prefix instructions or extension groups either.
As such, the maximum instruction length is 48 bits and can always be decoded by looking
at the first 16-bits of the instruction field.

The composition of fetch comes from 3 modules:

"""

"""
NOTES: On the BusIf, there's no way to cancel a request: once it's out, it's out.
       We don't know if it's taken or not, until the response comes back. This
       has two implications:
       1. We need to keep 'request' active until 'response' comes back.
       2. We need to throw away data during flushing

Things to test:
- Cancellation in all stages of a fetch
    - Cancelling in the same cycle we issue a request is busted: we update ADDR from the request,
      but cancel the first burst, so we start to fetch from the wrong address.
- Test all sorts of invalid instruction sequences.
- Bursts through a page boundary

NOTE: Fetch as-is now has a minimum 4-cycle latency:
    1 cycle to initiate the bus request
    1 cycle for the bus to give the reply
    1 cycle to get the data through the FIFO
    1 cycle to assemble the instruction
"""
"""
Branch handling:

do_branch is a global signal, that is registered at the output of 'execute'. This goes high for one cycle, signalling that
a new (non-consecutive, that is) address was loaded into $scp or $tcp or task_mode was changed. The new value of these
registers gets latched on the same clock cycle when do_branch goes high.

What needs to happen is that we need to cancel all in-process instructions and restart fetching from the new execution point.

1. Execute will not pass the branching instruction to memory. If there is a reservation (such as an AV in a load), it *does*
   pass a fake resoult over that clears the reservation.
2. Execute accepts the next instruction (if any), but cancells it. The way to do that is to override the output to be a simple
   pass-through for memory with write-enable disabled, so no actual change to the target register will occur, but the reservation
   gets deleted. TODO: the RF supports this, but memory/exec not yet.
3. Decode will also accept the next instruction (if any), it will however not attempt any reservations and won't pass it to execute either.
   TODO: decode doesn't actually do any of this yet.
4. inst_assemble will also accept the next 16-bits from the fetch queue, but will delete and restart
5. inst_queue will take the next word, but will reset after.
6. inst_buffer might push one word into the queue, but will cancel subsequent responses from the bus_if, even if they were already queued up.

TODO: should we consider simply cancelling all reservations in the RF upon a branch? The danger is the following:
   1. We have a loooong oustanding load.
   2. The next instruction is a branch that ... well, branches
   3. The first instruction at the branch target is something that depends on the target register of the load.
   We are lucky though: since the load hugs the bus, fetch will not succeed until the load returns the result, so by the time
   the fetched instruction winds its way through fetch, the results are safely in the RF. This is very brittle though and the
   first time we introduce an instruction buffer or some sort of a cache, the assumption is not valid anymore and I would wind up
   with an extremely hard to find heisen-bug.

   So, I'm not going to depend on this behavior.

TODO: yet another alternative is that we artificially hold off fetch with outstanding loads during a branch. That would mean exposing
   another wire, called 'doing_load' or something that is incorporated into the branch handling logic.

OVERALL: I think I'm going to stick with the fake write-back idea: that seems relatively clean at least.

    queue won't overflow, should we get all the responses back. We also make sure that we won't hold the bus
