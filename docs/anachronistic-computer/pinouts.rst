Pinouts
=======

According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_in-line_package:

Common DIP package pin counts are: 24, 28, 32, and 40; less common are 36, 48, 52, and 64. So if we blow over 40 pins, the next step up is 48.

How to make chips at home?
==========================

FPGAs, of course. Right now, it seems that Brew V1 synthesizes into ~800ALMs (LUTs) in a Cyclone V. Assuming a LUT is a LUT (not fair, depends on the number of inputs), any device with about 1000 to 2000 LUTs should fit the CPU. We also assume that the CPU is the biggest custom chip we would ever make, this same FPGA should fit all custom chips.

Looking at the landscape, the following devices seem to work well:

- Any of the MAX10 family, even the smallest one. However, these are *very* expensive, something around $30.
- ICE40LP1k from Lattice at $5.5
- T8Q144C3 from Efinix at $6.6
- LCMXO3L-4300E from Lattice at $7.7
- GoWin 1N FPGAs, probably the 4k or the 9k devices.

These are all 3.3V compatible parts, but only the latest lists LVTTL compatibility. However, LVTTL and LVCMOS33 is the same, it seems. Even the Mach3 chip can't take truly 5V inputs. So maybe that's another reason to require serial resistors on the DRAM data lines (and protection diodes). After all, those will be the only truly old parts in the real system. However, there seem to be 'modern' 3.3V FPM DRAMs (https://www.digikey.com/htmldatasheets/production/1700164/0/0/1/MSM51V17400F.pdf for instance).

All right, so we have 3.3V I/O and we're cool with that. We might have to build our own memory modules (after all SMD chips were not common back then). 30-pin sockets are not readily available anymore (eBay, others still carry it, but do we want to depend on them)? We can have the equivalent using single-row headers though, so no sweat.

These 3.3V memories are rather large, the above one is 16Mbit device in 4Mx4 config. So, qin a 16-bit (dual-bank) setup, that would create 8MByte of DRAM. That's 11 address lines: A0-A10. Righ now, we have only 9, but with the reduction of the data-bus to 8-bits, we can affort the extra address pin, at least on the CPU.

Universal Chips (UniC)
======================

An interesting idea is to make an FPGA-based chip, that can pretend to be anything.

Logic levels allow for a 3.3V I/O to be TTL compatible, provided we take care of the above-the-limit voltages:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7400-series_integrated_circuits#/media/File:Niveaux_logiques_CMOS-TTL-LVTTL.png

This can be done by a series 330 ohm resistor and a diode towards VCC. The resistor will limit the current to 5mA on the driver, if it hard-pulls to 5V. The resistor also (unfortunately) slows the transitions down, but hopefully not to the level where it's problematic: the RC constant with a 10pF load is 3.3ns, which is half the propagation delay of a single LS gate.

Power is more problematic: we don't know where the GND and VDD pins on the to-be-simulated package are. What we can do is to provide a pair of (Schottky) diodes towards the internal VDD and GND from each pin. These diodes would be on the 'outer' pin of the 330 ohm resistor and tied together on the top and bottom to provide my internal VDD and GND. This setup is tested in LTSpice and seems to work, albeit shifts the GND by maybe as much as 0.4V.

An LDO can then generate VCC from VDD. Due to the GND-shift, maybe it's better to generate a somewhat lower VCC, maybe 3.1V or so. That would split the difference in half.

There is a part (74S107 or something) that contains the right diode arrangement for 16 pins, though it might be a bit too large (TSSOP20 is the best it can do). There are quad-diode packages (2 pins worth) as well in the BV56 family.

We can add a tiny OLED display (https://www.ebay.com/itm/293291361583 for instance) to the top for fun displaying of the part number being emulated, maybe even small animations.

The PCB could be covered by a 3D printed snap-on plastic cover, pretending to be a DIP package.

Programming ideally would be done through USB, with a USB connector on one end of the package, but that might be a little too expensive, especially since that would need an FTDI chip of sorts as well.
