Instruction Set

Encoding overview
-----------------

There are three encoding variants:

16-bit instructions::

    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    |    FIELD_D    |    FIELD_C    |    FIELD_B    |    FIELD_A    |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

32-bit instructions::

    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    |    FIELD_D    |    FIELD_C    |    FIELD_B    |    FIELD_A    |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    |                         FIELD_E                               |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

48-bit instructions::

    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    |    FIELD_D    |    FIELD_C    |    FIELD_B    |    FIELD_A    |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+-...
    |                         FIELD_E  lower 16 bits              ...
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+-...

    ...-+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    ...                       FIELD_E   upper 16 bits               |
    ...-+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

FIELD_D:
  normally contains the register index of the [D]estination
FIELD_C:
  normally contains the instruction op-[C]ode
FIELD_B:
  normally contains the register index of the second operand (operand [B])
FIELD_A:
  normally contains the register index of the first operand (operand [A])
FIELD_E:
  normally contains an immediate or a memory offset

The whole 16 bit instruction is referred to as the INST.

The '[]' operator represents sub-fields in verilog notation.

The '{}' operator represents concatenation in verilog notation.

The ':' operator represents range (when that context make sense)

Register indexes:

===========    =============
Filed value    Register name
===========    =============
0x0            $r0
0x1            $r1
0x2            $r2
0x3            $r3
0x4            $r4
0x5            $r5
0x6            $r6
0x7            $r7
0x8            $r8
0x9            $r9
0xa            $r10
0xb            $r11
0xc            $r12
0xd            $r13
0xe            $r14
0xf            reserved
===========    =============

Register aliases:
    $sp:  alias to $r12
    $fp:  alias to $r13
    $lr:  alias to $r14

.. note::
  Aliases have (almost) nothing to do with HW and only make assembly unambiguous and/or easier to read. The only exception is that the ISA supports compact load-store operations with $r12 and $r13 as their base registers. There's no functional difference between these compact and the full-format load/store operations, but the intent is that by using these instructions to access stack-local variables allows much more compact code-size (close to ARM THUMB compactness).

Special registers:

$pc:
 denotes the current-context program counter, the pointer to the currently executing instruction.

$tpc:
 denotes the task-mode program counter. If the current execution context is TASK mode, $tpc is the same as $pc. In SCHEDULER mode, it's not.

.. note:: $pc and $tpc are 31-bit registers: the LSB is ignored on write and always reads as 0.

Register Types
--------------

The type of the data held in a register is stored as side-band information next to the register data. The meaning of various instruction opcodes depend on the register types they operate on.

.. note::
  Since compilers (at least GCC) don't differentiate between signed and unsigned integer types, the HW doesn't do that either. This means that certain integer operations have a signed and an unsigned version.

There are up to 15 register types supported by the ISA, but only the following are in defined at the moment:

==========    =========   ==========
Type code     Type        Note
==========    =========   ==========
0x0           INT32       32-bit integer: this is the default type of all registers after reset
0x1           INT16X2     2-way 16-bit integer vector
0x2           INT8X4      4-way 8-bit integer vector
0x3           UINT16X2S   Unsigned, saturated version on INT16X2
0x4           SINT16X2S   Signed, saturated version on INT16X2
0x5           UINT8X4S    Unsigned, saturated version on INT8X4
0x6           SINT8X4S    Signed, saturated version on INT8X4
0x8           FP32        32-bit float
0x9           FP16X2      2-way 16-bit float vector
0xf           mask        prevents target type changes during type ... <- ... type operations
==========    =========   ==========

Instruction Set Summary
-----------------------

In the following tables

'.':
  means any value in [0x0:0xe], unless specifically listed as a special case. Can be a different number at every occurrence.
'*':
 means any value in [0x0:0xf] Can be a different number at every occurrence.

Instructions are fully decoded. Any instruction not explicitly mentioned in the tables below generate an 'invalid instruction exception' and is functionally equivalent to the SII instruction.

All instructions in this group enter SCHEDULER mode. After execution $tpc points to the current instruction (the one generating the exception)

=================  ========

Every instruction in this group implements a fence, or an ordering between loads and stores. The top-most 4 bits of the instruction code is used the encode the fence type:

==========   ============
Bit-field    Meaning
==========   ============
12           ~R-before
13           ~W-before
14           ~R-after
15           ~W-after
==========   ============

.. note::
  bit-values are inverted to make FIELD_D==0xf an invalid encoding (i.e. no fence specification)

.. note::
  Fences have no effect on cache contents. In particular, fences don't invalidate the instruction cache (if exists) and cannot be exclusively used to implement coherency between data and instruction stream such as needed for self-modifying code.

.. important::
  Depending on the implementation, some or all of these fence operations might be no-ops. Care should be taken to ensure proper fence behavior for writes that leave in-order but have their side-effects out-of-order due to latency-differences through the interconnect.

.. note::
  All instruction codes in this group are treated as jump instructions by the branch predictor, if exists. After warming up, some will always be predicted taken, some will not be. In TASK mode indirect jump (0x.002) and $tpc update (0x.003) instructions have the exact same behavior, however might have different latencies.

.. todo::
  We might want to shift encoding to 0x.004 ... 0x.007 to make the branch predictors job easier at recognizing this class.

.. [#note_logical] This operation ignore type info, but sets destination type to be the same as that of $rA
.. [#note_binary_shift] This operation only uses the lane-setup part of the type information. It sets the destination type to that of $rA
.. [#note0xXaXX] This operation is useful for lane-combining with an inverted predicate
.. [#note0xXbXX] FIELD_A is one's complement-coded; range is -7...7. This operation only uses the lane-setup part of the type information. It sets the destination type to that of $rA

.. note::
  If swizzle muxes are inline in the pipeline (as opposed to their own execution unit), it's possible to deal with scalar-vector combinations, where the scalar gets automatically replicated into the right number of lanes before the operation is performed. Similarly, a 2-lane-and-4-lane vector operation can replicate the 2-lane vector into 4 lanes before executing the operation.

.. todo::
  What should the behavior be for unsupported type-combinations? One would probably want an exception so that SW emulation can fill the gaps on lower-end processors, but then again, that makes almost all operations a possible exception source, and thus forces the pipeline to be more conservative.

.. note:: Output type is the type of $rA

.. note:: Pseudo instructions
  NOP: encodes to 0x2222, which is $r2 <- $r2 | $r2
  $rD <- $rS: encodes to 0xD2SS

.. [#note_immedate_types]
  Types for each register are encoded in 4-bit nibbles. Lowest 4 bits determine the type of the lowest indexed register. Highest 4 bits determine the type of the highest indexed register.

.. note:: Result type is that of $rB (even for shifts). FIELD_E is assumed to have the same type as $rB

.. note::
  << and >> operations where opB is constant can be expressed by multiplies. Because of that, these operations only have one form. This does mean though, that the constant needed for certain shifts is larger than what would normally be required (i.e. 32-bit instead of 16).

  only lower 8 bits of value has any meaning, all selection options are valid, independent of type NOTE: in ASM, this is represented as a 4-digit number, each digit of the value 0...3, representing each lane, so for instance 0000 would replicate byte 0 into all 4 bytes

.. note::
  FIELD_E is assumed to be of matching scalar type for $rA. It is sign-extended to 32-bits, then replicated for each lane.

.. note::
  result type is that of $rA

.. note::
  FIELD_E is *always* sign-extended to 32-bits before applying it to the operation.

.. todo::
  We might want to zero-extend for certain operations, such as logical ops.

.. note::
  Sign-extending a 16-bit constant, then treating it as a float almost certainly don't make any sense.

Stack group
~~~~~~~~~~~

While stack operations (as in push/pull) are not supported by the ISA, special load/store instructions are provided with small offsets and $r12 ($fp) and $r13 ($sp) as the base register to support compact form of common stack-load and store- operations. The supported offset range us -256 to +252 bytes.

  FIELD_E is used as an 8-bit mask: 1 denotes setting the type for a register, 0 denotes leaving the type unchanged. LSB corresponds to the lowest order register, bit-8 to the highest order. The upper byte of FIELD_E is ignored.

Extension groups
----------------

Extension groups allow for extending the instruction set by utilizing otherwise unused portions of the 16-bit instruction code-space, followed by a second 16-bit instruction code. These extension groups allow for expressing seldom used or specialized instructions while not impacting the compactness of the base ISA.

0xfff1 0x.0..              $rD <- interpolate $rA, $rB
=========================  ============================  ==================

This instruction performs linear interpolation between adjacent lanes of $rA using the value of $rB as a fractional 32-bit value.

A 2-lane operation is as follows::

  $rD(0) <- $rA(0) *    $rB  + $rA(1) * (1-$rB)
  $rD(1) <- $rA(0) * (1-$rB) + $rA(1) *    $rB

A 4-lane operation is as follows::

  $rD(0) <- $rA(0) *    $rB  + $rA(1) * (1-$rB)
  $rD(1) <- $rA(0) * (1-$rB) + $rA(1) *    $rB
  $rD(3) <- $rA(3) *    $rB  + $rA(4) * (1-$rB)
  $rD(4) <- $rA(3) * (1-$rB) + $rA(4) *    $rB

0xff1* 0x.1..              $rD <- full $rA * $rB >> FIELD_F
=========================  ==================================  ==================

.. todo::
  This group can be implemented in the 0xfff. style in the following way: 0xfff8/0xfff9: arithmetic shift by FIELD_C[+32], 0xfffa/0xfffb: logical shift by FIELD_C[+32]. That would free up this whole extension group and result in a much more compact encoding, but the binutils is not built this way at the moment.

Prefix instructions
-------------------

Prefix instructions can precede any other instruction to modify their behavior.

.. note::
  *Exception behavior*: If a prefixed instruction throws an exception, $tpc points to the (first) prefix instruction after entering SCHEDULER mode. This allows the recovery code to decode and potentially retry the excepted instruction.

.. note::
  *Interrupt behavior*: If an interrupt is handled during the execution of a prefixed instruction, $tpc points to the (first) prefix instruction after entering SCHEDULER mode. None of the side-effects of the prefixed instruction take effect. If any of the side-effects of the prefixed instruction have taken effect, the whole instruction must be carried to completion and $tpc points to the subsequent instruction after entering SCHEDULER mode. In other words, under no circumstances can $tpc point anywhere between the first prefix and it's corresponding instruction when entering SCHEDULER mode.

.. note::
  *Prefix concatenation*: Every processor implementation has a maximum instruction length it supports. In this version of the spec, it's 64 bits. So, if the instruction (pre-)decode stage finds an instruction longer then that maximum, it raises an invalid instruction exception (or more precisely, it replaces the decoded instruction with that of the SII instruction. Without this provision it would be possible to create arbitrarily long instruction sequences in TASK mode. That in turn would prevent interrupts from being raised, effectively locking up the system (at least up to the point of exhausting the addressable RAM space).

Type override
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This prefix instruction allows for the changing the way the subsequent operation interprets source operand types. It doesn't actually change the source register types. It also allows for explicit control of whether the destination type is written or not.

::

  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  |     TYPE_A    | 1 | 1 | 1 | D | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |    TYPE_B     | ...
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

Type override for $rA (TYPE_A) and $rB (TYPE_B). If D is set, $rD type is written
back into the register file. If cleared, $rD's type is not changed.


Unused instruction groups
-------------------------

All of the following instruction groups are explicitly reserved for future use. All processor implementations must raise an invalid instruction exception upon encountering them. The instruction size is shown as guidance for future uses: a simple instruction size decode logic would identify these groups as the shown size. It is not guaranteed that they are going to be used in such a fashion nor does it really matter for processor implementations following this version of the ISA specification.

  if FIELD_D == 0x2 and FIELD_B == 0xe, the branch predictor is allowed to treat this instruction code as a conditional branch.

Cache invalidation
==================

There are instructions to invalidate individual data-, instruction- and L2 cache lines. These are encoded in the various load/store groups. There is no way to distinguish which cache we intend to invalidate. There is also no instruction provided for complete cache invalidation: this functionality is to be provided through memory-mapped CSRs.
