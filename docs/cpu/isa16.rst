Instruction Set
===============

A small excursion into an old topic: what would a 16-bit ISA variant look like?
The idea here is that we would still support 32-bit addressing through register-pairs, but try to eliminate all 48-bit instructions. This would add an extra cycle to decode when 32-bit addresses are needed. It would make far jumps and calls difficult, but here's the thing: if we target a machine to earlier then even '83, the memory shipped with the machine would not be more than 128k. With the protection features and unified memory, it's actually not all that likely that your code-space would be greater than 32k, in which case 16-bit PC-relative jumps are just fine.

Finally, maybe there's even a way to make this ISA forwards compatible by designating a 16-bit register type field.

Register pairs are denoted as $drX, where X is an even number. So $dr0 := [$r1:$r0], $dr2 := [$r3:$r2] etc. For instructions where double registers are used, the top 3 bits of the register field denotes the $dr index. The bottom bit is set to 1 for register, 0 for immediate extension options. This allows for using 19-bit immediate offsets, or 512k addressable memory without the use of registers.

Paired with some intelligent address space decoding, that should work for these early systems.

The more I think about it, this instruction set is viable, but not as a 'dumbed down' version of the 32-bit ISA. It's a *different* and unique ISA and should not attempt to remain forwards compatible.

This ISA needs a lot more work. I think it's quite possible to encode all odd and even register pairs and have (for immediate ld/st) a 4-bit address-extension field. That would allow for 1MB direct-addressable memory.

Encoding overview
-----------------

There are three encoding variants:

16-bit instructions::

    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    |    FIELD_D    |    FIELD_C    |    FIELD_B    |    FIELD_A    |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

32-bit instructions::

    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    |    FIELD_D    |    FIELD_C    |    FIELD_B    |    FIELD_A    |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    |                         FIELD_E                               |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

FIELD_D:
  normally contains the register index of the [D]estination
FIELD_C:
  normally contains the instruction op-[C]ode
FIELD_B:
  normally contains the register index of the second operand (operand [B])
FIELD_A:
  normally contains the register index of the first operand (operand [A])
FIELD_E:
  normally contains an immediate or a memory offset

The whole 16 bit instruction is referred to as the INST.

The '[]' operator represents sub-fields in verilog notation.

The '{}' operator represents concatenation in verilog notation.

The ':' operator represents range (when that context make sense)

Register indexes:

===========    =============

0x1            $r1

0xb            $dr5
0xd            $dr6
===========    =============

Register aliases:
    $sp:  alias to $dr5
    $fp:  alias to $dr6
    $lr:  alias to $dr4

.. note::
  Aliases have (almost) nothing to do with HW and only make assembly unambiguous and/or easier to read. The only exception is that the ISA supports compact load-store operations with $sp and $fp as their base registers. There's no functional difference between these compact and the full-format load/store operations, but the intent is that by using these instructions to access stack-local variables allows much more compact code-size (close to ARM THUMB compactness).

Special registers:

$pc:
 denotes the current-context program counter, the pointer to the currently executing instruction.

$tpc:
 denotes the task-mode program counter. If the current execution context is TASK mode, $tpc is the same as $pc. In SCHEDULER mode, it's not.

.. note:: $pc and $tpc are 31-bit registers: the LSB is ignored on write and always reads as 0.

Register Types
--------------

The type of the data held in a register is stored as side-band information next to the register data. The meaning of various instruction opcodes depend on the register types they operate on.

.. note::
  Since compilers (at least GCC) don't differentiate between signed and unsigned integer types, the HW doesn't do that either. This means that certain integer operations have a signed and an unsigned version.

There are up to 15 register types supported by the ISA, but only the following are in defined at the moment:

==========    =========   ==========
Type code     Type        Note
==========    =========   ==========
0x0           INT32       32-bit integer
0x1           INT16       16-bit integer: this is the default type of all registers after reset
0x2           INT16X2     2-way 16-bit integer vector
0x3           INT8X4      4-way 8-bit integer vector
0x4           UINT16X2S   Unsigned, saturated version on INT16X2
0x5           SINT16X2S   Signed, saturated version on INT16X2
0x6           UINT8X4S    Unsigned, saturated version on INT8X4
0x7           SINT8X4S    Signed, saturated version on INT8X4
0x8           FP32        32-bit float
0x9           FP16X2      2-way 16-bit float vector
0xf           mask        prevents target type changes during type ... <- ... type operations

Instruction Set Summary
-----------------------

In the following tables

'.':
  means any value in [0x0:0xe], unless specifically listed as a special case. Can be a different number at every occurrence.
'*':
 means any value in [0x0:0xf] Can be a different number at every occurrence.

Instructions are fully decoded. Any instruction not explicitly mentioned in the tables below generate an 'invalid instruction exception' and is functionally equivalent to the SII instruction.

=================  ========

Every instruction in this group implements a fence, or an ordering between loads and stores. The top-most 4 bits of the instruction code is used the encode the fence type:

==========   ============
Bit-field    Meaning
==========   ============
12           ~R-before
13           ~W-before
14           ~R-after
15           ~W-after
==========   ============

.. note::
  bit-values are inverted to make FIELD_D==0xf an invalid encoding (i.e. no fence specification)

.. note::
  Fences have no effect on cache contents. In particular, fences don't invalidate the instruction cache (if exists) and cannot be exclusively used to implement coherency between data and instruction stream such as needed for self-modifying code.

.. important::
  Depending on the implementation, some or all of these fence operations might be no-ops. Care should be taken to ensure proper fence behavior for writes that leave in-order but have their side-effects out-of-order due to latency-differences through the interconnect.

.. note::
  If swizzle muxes are inline in the pipeline (as opposed to their own execution unit), it's possible to deal with scalar-vector combinations, where the scalar gets automatically replicated into the right number of lanes before the operation is performed. Similarly, a 2-lane-and-4-lane vector operation can replicate the 2-lane vector into 4 lanes before executing the operation.

.. todo::
  What should the behavior be for unsupported type-combinations? One would probably want an exception so that SW emulation can fill the gaps on lower-end processors, but then again, that makes almost all operations a possible exception source, and thus forces the pipeline to be more conservative.

Stack group
~~~~~~~~~~~

While stack operations (as in push/pull) are not supported by the ISA, special load/store instructions are provided with small offsets and $r0 ($sp) and $r1 ($lr) as the base register to support compact form of common stack-load and store- operations. The supported offset range us -256 to +252 bytes.

Extension groups
----------------

Extension groups allow for extending the instruction set by utilizing otherwise unused portions of the 16-bit instruction code-space, followed by a second 16-bit instruction code. These extension groups allow for expressing seldom used or specialized instructions while not impacting the compactness of the base ISA.

=========================  ============================  ==================
0xfff1 0x.0..              $rD <- interpolate $rA, $rB
=========================  ============================  ==================

This instruction performs linear interpolation between adjacent lanes of $rA using the value of $rB as a fractional 32-bit value.

A 2-lane operation is as follows::

  $rD(0) <- $rA(0) *    $rB  + $rA(1) * (1-$rB)
  $rD(1) <- $rA(0) * (1-$rB) + $rA(1) *    $rB

A 4-lane operation is as follows::

  $rD(0) <- $rA(0) *    $rB  + $rA(1) * (1-$rB)
  $rD(1) <- $rA(0) * (1-$rB) + $rA(1) *    $rB
  $rD(3) <- $rA(3) *    $rB  + $rA(4) * (1-$rB)
  $rD(4) <- $rA(3) * (1-$rB) + $rA(4) *    $rB


Scaled multiply group
---------------------Register types
--------------

Each register has a type associated with it. Types are changed and propagated by instructions. They can be loaded and stored independent of the values contained in the registers.

The dynamic typing of registers gives great flexibility ot the ISA and allows future growth and extensibility. There is however overhead associated with managing register types. This overhead is minimized if the compiler dedicates types to certain registers and keep them constant as much as possible.

.. note::

    Almost all processors have a similar concept for floating-point (and vector) registers: they have their own type, except this type is fixed. One can see the Brew way of dealing with register types as a more flexible partitioning of the register-file. A way that can adapt to the needs of the application at hand.

Register types determine the semantics of many operations, especially in the unary, binary ALU groups and in conditional branches.

Type-less variant
-----------------

A type-less variant of the ISA is possible: in this case, all registers are assumed to have the type of INT32 and type-change instructions have no effect.

0xff1* 0x.1..              $rD <- full $rA * $rB >> FIELD_F
=========================  ==================================  ==================

.. todo::
  This group can be implemented in the 0xfff. style in the following way: 0xfff8/0xfff9: arithmetic shift by FIELD_C[+32], 0xfffa/0xfffb: logical shift by FIELD_C[+32]. That would free up this whole extension group and result in a much more compact encoding, but the binutils is not built this way at the moment.

Prefix instructions
-------------------

Prefix instructions can precede any other instruction to modify their behavior.

.. note::
  *Exception behavior*: If a prefixed instruction throws an exception, $tpc points to the (first) prefix instruction after entering SCHEDULER mode. This allows the recovery code to decode and potentially retry the excepted instruction.

.. note::
  *Interrupt behavior*: If an interrupt is handled during the execution of a prefixed instruction, $tpc points to the (first) prefix instruction after entering SCHEDULER mode. None of the side-effects of the prefixed instruction take effect. If any of the side-effects of the prefixed instruction have taken effect, the whole instruction must be carried to completion and $tpc points to the subsequent instruction after entering SCHEDULER mode. In other words, under no circumstances can $tpc point anywhere between the first prefix and it's corresponding instruction when entering SCHEDULER mode.

.. note::
  *Prefix concatenation*: Every processor implementation has a maximum instruction length it supports. In this version of the spec, it's 64 bits. So, if the instruction (pre-)decode stage finds an instruction longer then that maximum, it raises an invalid instruction exception (or more precisely, it replaces the decoded instruction with that of the SII instruction. Without this provision it would be possible to create arbitrarily long instruction sequences in TASK mode. That in turn would prevent interrupts from being raised, effectively locking up the system (at least up to the point of exhausting the addressable RAM space).

Type override
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This prefix instruction allows for the changing the way the subsequent operation interprets source operand types. It doesn't actually change the source register types. It also allows for explicit control of whether the destination type is written or not.

::

  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  |     TYPE_A    | 1 | 1 | 1 | D | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |    TYPE_B     | ...
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

Type override for $rA (TYPE_A) and $rB (TYPE_B). If D is set, $rD type is written
back into the register file. If cleared, $rD's type is not changed.


Unused instruction groups
-------------------------

All of the following instruction groups are explicitly reserved for future use. All processor implementations must raise an invalid instruction exception upon encountering them. The instruction size is shown as guidance for future uses: a simple instruction size decode logic would identify these groups as the shown size. It is not guaranteed that they are going to be used in such a fashion nor does it really matter for processor implementations following this version of the ISA specification.

Cache invalidation
==================

There are instructions to invalidate individual data-, instruction- and L2 cache lines. These are encoded in the various load/store groups. There is no way to distinguish which cache we intend to invalidate. There is also no instruction provided for complete cache invalidation: this functionality is to be provided through memory-mapped CSRs.
